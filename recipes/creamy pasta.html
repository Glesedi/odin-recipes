    <h3>Creamy Pasta</h3>
    <p> Creamy Pastsa is a Italian dish</p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>chicken stock</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>milk</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
    </li>Do salt the water you boil your pasta in. No oil, just salt. The pasta needs time to absorb salt while it is in the water so it is not bland when it hits your plate.</li>
    <li>Always cook your pasta al dente. Buying 100% durum semolina pasta makes it easier to achieve since its got a bit of a chew.</li>
    <li>You will notice this recipe has no flour or starch to thicken the sauce. It is not necessary if you use heavy or double cream. The fat content of at least of 36% in the cream is enough to make a perfect sauce, that coats the pasta but not too thick and gloopy. It should be fluid, rich and luxurious.</li>
    <li>Dont forget to reserve some water the pasta was cooked in to add to the sauce later. The main reason for is because hot pasta absorbs liquid very quickly and greedily.</li>
     <li>And even though you made enough sauce to serve with your pasta, the minute you combine the two a portion of the sauce gets absorbed, and all of a sudden you have got dry pasta but what we want is saucy! Here is when your reserved starchy water comes to the rescue and turns your pasta into something silky smooth and lovely.</li>  
    <li>Always dress your hot pasta with a sauce before serving! This point is actually very important as I often see sauce on the side in peoples homes and bloggers photos. There is really no good reason for it. All it does is exposes your undressed pasta and makes it dry and flavourless</li>
     </ol>
